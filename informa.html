            <p><strong>Position:</strong><br>Digital Product Executive</p>

            <p class="description">Informa is a B2B events company serving in the Pharmaceutical and Food Ingredients industries. The company organizes 13 events in a year, uniting buyers and sellers under one roof, where visitors can build valuable relationships. Events range from small to large, with some events accomodating around 50,000 visitors in the span of 3 days.</p>
            <p class="description"><strong>I joined the UBM team during a season of change.</strong>The company was just starting its merger with London-based company events conglomerate, Informa, and also beginning its move towards the new app developer, Sherpa Solutions. An app was developed for each event, so 13 applications in total. The Digital team consisted of myself, sales, project management, and the Product Manager.</p>

            <!-- First Project -->
            <h2>Developing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
            <p class="description">My first major project took 3 months, and had the following objectives:</p> 
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Defining the requirements for the app:</strong> this was challenging, as I first had to learn about the users, what the company was capable of doing and the needs of the internal stakeholders.</li>
                    <p class="description"> I achieved this through a combination of desk and field research. I found previous research done for the app, including customer satisfaction surveys, product reports, and materials left by my predecessor. The field research was achieved through lots, and lots of meetings. I wanted to speak to key stakeholders (i.e. brand, marketing, sales) to see what had worked previously, what could be done better. These groups knew more than I ever would through any amount of research, and talking to them was pivotal to getting this right. Together with the Product Manager, we put together our MoScoW's (Must Haves, Should Haves, and Would Haves). </P>  
                    <p class="description"> During a 3-day workshop with our app developers, we were able to iron out was what was feasible</p>
                <li><strong>To lay the UI foundation of the new Mobile App:</strong> Both the previous and new suppliers are template-based, but while the previous supplier used a list-view style with little customization options, Sherpa instead offered much more.</li>

        <p><br>The above images were created in Photoshop and InDesign for two of Informa's digital products, the Mobile App and Supplier Finder. The left two images were created for the Sales team for two different channels. The title screen ad was intended for email distribution, whilst the center image was part of the Media Kit, a paper flyer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlight previous results of the products using past event editions as a base;</li>
            <li>Show the products as desirable - the images were created using screenshots of the application rather than concept art, to not mislead users.</li>
